    Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy 
    into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities. 
    This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are 
    synthesized from carbon dioxide and water.
    
    Key terms include:
    - Photosynthesis: The process of converting light energy to chemical energy
    - Chlorophyll: The green pigment in plants that absorbs light
    - Stomata: Small openings in leaves that allow gas exchange
    
    The process involves several steps:
    1. Light absorption by chlorophyll
    2. Water absorption through roots
    3. Carbon dioxide intake through stomata
    4. Conversion of light energy to chemical energy
    5. Production of glucose and oxygen
