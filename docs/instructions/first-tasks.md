Guiding Philosophy for Initial Development
Foundation First: The goal is not to build every feature at once, but to create a robust, high-quality "happy path" from raw text to an intelligent chat response.
Modularity is Key: Each component (Deconstruction, Ingestion, Chat) will be built as a distinct, testable module. This will pay dividends as the system's complexity grows.
Iterate Towards Excellence: The first version of the LearningBlueprint generator won't be perfect. The plan is to get it working, then iterate and improve its intelligence over time.
Part 0: Pre-flight Checklist (Setup & Foundational Decisions)
This part covers the essential setup required before writing the first endpoint. This should be Sprint 0.

Initialize the Project:

Technology: Python 3.11+
Framework: FastAPI
Dependency Management: Use Poetry (recommended) or Pipenv to manage dependencies and create a virtual environment. This ensures reproducible builds.
Establish Project Structure: A clean, scalable structure is critical.

Configuration & Security:

Use a .env file to manage all external configuration (LLM API keys, database URLs, vector DB keys). Use pydantic-settings to load these into a typed configuration object.
Implement basic API key security for all endpoints from day one using FastAPI's Security dependencies.
Tooling Selection:

Primary AI Framework: As recommended previously, start with LlamaIndex. It is purpose-built for high-quality RAG and will accelerate your Blueprint-to-Node ingestion and retrieval logic.
Vector Database: Choose your initial vector store. Pinecone's free tier is excellent for starting. Alternatively, consider a self-hosted option like Qdrant or Weaviate if you prefer more control.
Part 1: The Core Deconstruction Engine (Sprint 1-2)
The first functional goal is to perfect the /deconstruct endpoint. Without a quality LearningBlueprint, the rest of the system is handicapped.

[ENDPOINT] POST /deconstruct
[GOAL] Take raw text and produce a validated LearningBlueprint JSON object with loci and pathways.
Plan of Action:

Define the Schema: In app/models/learning_blueprint.py, create a detailed Pydantic model for the LearningBlueprint. This is your contract. It should include typed definitions for Locus, Pathway, and the overall structure. This gives you automatic validation.
Build the "Specialist" Agents: In app/core/deconstruction.py, create functions that call an LLM for specific sub-tasks.
extract_foundational_concepts(text: str) -> List[Locus]
extract_key_terms(text: str) -> List[Locus]
identify_relationships(loci: List[Locus]) -> List[Pathway]
Start simple. The first versions might just identify concepts without complex relationships.
Orchestrate with the "Dispatcher": In app/api/endpoints.py, the /deconstruct logic will call the specialist functions. For now, this can be a simple series of calls. The "UUE_Auditor" and "JSON_Finalizer" are essentially the final validation step against your Pydantic model.
Stub and Test: Heavily test this module. Use a sample piece of text and manually create the "ideal" LearningBlueprint JSON you expect. Write unit tests that check if your deconstruction pipeline gets reasonably close to this ideal output.
