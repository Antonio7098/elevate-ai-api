# Blueprint Editing Service Overview

## Overview

The Blueprint Editing Service provides comprehensive AI-powered editing capabilities for all components of the learning blueprint system, including blueprints, knowledge primitives, mastery criteria, and questions. It follows the same architectural pattern as the existing note editing service but extends it to handle the full blueprint ecosystem.

## Architecture

```

├── Core Service (blueprint_editing_service.py)
├── Granular Editing (granular_editing_service.py)
├── Data Models (blueprint_editing_models.py)
└── API Endpoints (blueprint_editing_endpoints.py)
```

## Key Components

### 1. Core Service (`BlueprintEditingService`)

The main service that orchestrates all editing operations:

- **Blueprint Editing**: Full blueprint structure and content editing
- **Primitive Editing**: Knowledge primitive definition and relationship editing
- **Mastery Criterion Editing**: Assessment criteria and learning pathway editing
- **Question Editing**: Question quality and difficulty editing

### 2. Granular Editing Service (`GranularBlueprintEditingService`)

Provides precise, targeted editing capabilities:

- **Section Operations**: Add, remove, edit, reorder blueprint sections
- **Primitive Operations**: Add, remove, edit, reorder knowledge primitives
- **Criterion Operations**: Add, remove, edit, reorder mastery criteria
- **Question Operations**: Add, remove, edit, reorder questions

### 3. Data Models (`blueprint_editing_models.py`)

Comprehensive Pydantic models for all editing operations:

- **Request Models**: `BlueprintEditingRequest`, `PrimitiveEditingRequest`, etc.
- **Response Models**: `BlueprintEditingResponse`, `PrimitiveEditingResponse`, etc.
- **Suggestion Models**: `EditingSuggestion`, `BlueprintContext`, etc.
- **Enums**: `EditType`, `SuggestionType` for type safety

### 4. API Endpoints (`blueprint_editing_endpoints.py`)

RESTful API endpoints for all editing operations:

- **Blueprint Endpoints**: `/blueprint/edit`, `/blueprint/{id}/suggestions`
- **Primitive Endpoints**: `/primitive/edit`, `/primitive/{id}/suggestions`
- **Criterion Endpoints**: `/criterion/edit`, `/criterion/{id}/suggestions`
- **Question Endpoints**: `/question/edit`, `/question/{id}/suggestions`
- **Utility Endpoints**: `/health`, `/capabilities`

## Supported Edit Types

### Blueprint Edits
- `edit_section`, `add_section`, `remove_section`, `reorder_sections`
- `edit_primitive`, `add_primitive`, `remove_primitive`, `reorder_primitives`
- `edit_criterion`, `add_criterion`, `remove_criterion`, `reorder_criteria`
- `edit_question`, `add_question`, `remove_question`, `reorder_questions`

### Content Edits
- `improve_clarity`, `improve_structure`, `add_examples`
- `simplify_language`, `enhance_detail`, `correct_errors`

## Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Editing
- Context-aware editing based on blueprint structure
- Intelligent suggestions for improvements
- Reasoning for all changes made
- Preservation of learning relationships

### 2. Granular Control
- Precise editing at any level (section, primitive, criterion, question)
- Batch operations for multiple components
- Structure preservation options
- Version control and change tracking

### 3. Context Awareness
- Blueprint section hierarchy understanding
- Knowledge primitive relationship mapping
- Mastery criterion progression tracking
- Question difficulty and quality assessment

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Grammar and clarity suggestions
- Structural organization improvements
- Content consistency checks
- Learning objective alignment

## Usage Examples

### Editing a Blueprint Section

```python
request = BlueprintEditingRequest(
    blueprint_id=1,
    edit_type="edit_section",
    edit_instruction="Make the introduction more engaging and add learning objectives",
    preserve_original_structure=True,
    include_reasoning=True
)

response = await blueprint_service.edit_blueprint_agentically(request)
```

### Getting Editing Suggestions

```python
suggestions = await blueprint_service.get_blueprint_editing_suggestions(
    blueprint_id=1,
    include_structure=True,
    include_content=True,
    include_relationships=True
)
```

### Editing a Knowledge Primitive

```python
request = PrimitiveEditingRequest(
    primitive_id=1,
    edit_type="improve_clarity",
    edit_instruction="Simplify the concept definition for beginners",
    preserve_original_structure=True,
    include_reasoning=True
)

response = await blueprint_service.edit_primitive_agentically(request)
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Database Schema Alignment
- Works with the new blueprint-centric Prisma schema
- Supports all relationship types (prerequisites, related concepts, etc.)
- Maintains data integrity during editing operations

### LLM Service Integration
- Uses the existing `LLMService` for AI operations
- Consistent prompt engineering patterns
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Authentication & Authorization
- Integrates with existing user authentication system
- User-specific editing permissions
- Audit trail for all changes

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:

- Service initialization and configuration
- All editing operation types
- Suggestion generation
- Error handling and edge cases
- Mock LLM service integration

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced AI Features
- Multi-modal editing (text, images, diagrams)
- Collaborative editing with conflict resolution
- Real-time editing suggestions
- Learning analytics integration

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Caching for frequently accessed blueprints
- Batch processing for large-scale edits
- Async processing for long-running operations
- Database query optimization

### 3. User Experience
- Visual editing interface
- Drag-and-drop section reordering
- Real-time preview of changes
- Undo/redo functionality

## Conclusion

The Blueprint Editing Service provides a comprehensive, AI-powered solution for editing all aspects of the learning blueprint system. It maintains the architectural patterns established by the note editing service while extending functionality to handle the full complexity of blueprint-based learning systems.

The service is designed to be:
- **Scalable**: Handles blueprints of any size and complexity
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns and comprehensive testing
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new editing capabilities and AI features
- **Reliable**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

This foundation enables users to create, refine, and optimize their learning blueprints with intelligent AI assistance while maintaining the integrity and coherence of the learning system.
