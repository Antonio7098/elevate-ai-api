# Premium Intelligent Learning System - High-Level Architecture

## Overview

The Premium Intelligent Learning System is an advanced AI-powered learning companion that provides significantly enhanced capabilities compared to the basic system. It uses cutting-edge technologies like LangGraph for multi-agent orchestration, GraphRAG for sophisticated knowledge retrieval, and adaptive learning algorithms to create personalized learning experiences.

## System Architecture

### 1. **Two-Tier System Design**

The system operates on two distinct tiers:

#### **Basic Tier (Existing System)**
- **Users**: Free or basic subscription users
- **Capabilities**: Standard RAG chat, basic question generation, simple context assembly
- **Technology**: Single LLM responses, basic vector search, simple memory system
- **Endpoints**: `/chat/message`, `/deconstruct`, `/generate-questions`

#### **Premium Tier (New Advanced System)**
- **Users**: Premium subscription users
- **Capabilities**: Multi-agent orchestration, GraphRAG, adaptive learning, advanced analytics
- **Technology**: LangGraph workflows, Neo4j knowledge graphs, sophisticated memory systems
- **Endpoints**: `/premium/chat/advanced`, `/premium/learning/workflow`, `/premium/analytics`

### 2. **Core Components**

#### **A. Multi-Agent Orchestration (LangGraph)**

The premium system uses LangGraph to coordinate multiple specialized AI agents:

- **Routing Agent**: Analyzes user queries and decides which expert agents to involve
- **Explanation Agent**: Provides detailed explanations with diagrams, code examples, and analogies
- **Assessment Agent**: Generates adaptive questions and evaluates answers with detailed feedback
- **Content Curator Agent**: Finds and recommends personalized learning resources
- **Learning Planner Agent**: Creates and adapts personalized learning paths
- **Research Agent**: Conducts academic research and synthesizes information

**How it works**: When a premium user asks a question, the system doesn't just give a simple answer. Instead, it orchestrates multiple agents working together. For example, if a user asks "Explain backpropagation," the system might:
1. Have the Research Agent gather the latest information
2. Have the Explanation Agent create a detailed explanation with diagrams
3. Have the Assessment Agent generate practice questions
4. Have the Content Curator Agent recommend additional resources
5. Have the Learning Planner Agent suggest next steps in their learning journey

#### **B. GraphRAG (Knowledge Graph + Vector Search)**

The premium system combines two types of knowledge retrieval:

- **Vector Database (Pinecone)**: For semantic similarity search across text content
- **Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)**: For explicit relationships and structured reasoning

**How it works**: Instead of just finding similar text, the system can traverse relationships in the knowledge graph. For example, if a user asks about "gradient descent," the system can:
1. Find relevant text chunks about gradient descent
2. Traverse the knowledge graph to find related concepts (optimization, calculus, machine learning)
3. Understand prerequisite relationships (what you need to know before learning gradient descent)
4. Identify common misconceptions and learning challenges

#### **C. Advanced Memory System**

The premium system uses a sophisticated three-tier memory system:

- **Episodic Memory**: Remembers specific learning sessions and interactions
- **Semantic Memory**: Stores factual knowledge and concepts
- **Procedural Memory**: Tracks skills and learning procedures
- **Working Memory**: Manages current focus and attention

**How it works**: The system remembers not just what you've learned, but how you learned it, what you struggled with, and what learning strategies work best for you. It can adapt explanations based on your learning history and preferences.

#### **D. Context Assembly Agent (CAA)**

The premium system includes a sophisticated Context Assembly Agent that implements the latest research in retrieval-augmented generation:

**10-Stage Pipeline:**
1. **Input Normalization**: Integrates user context and session memory
2. **Query Augmentation**: Creates contextual retrieval prompts with personalization
3. **Coarse Retrieval**: Hybrid search (BM25 + dense embeddings) for broad coverage
4. **Graph Traversal**: Explores knowledge graph for related concepts and prerequisites
5. **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Uses advanced reranking for task fitness, factuality, and mode suitability
6. **Sufficiency Checking**: Verifies if assembled context can answer the query
7. **Context Condensation**: Compresses while preserving facts and citations
8. **Tool Enrichment**: Integrates dynamic tool outputs (calculator, code execution, web search)
9. **Final Assembly**: Packages context with provenance and metadata
10. **Cache & Metrics**: Stores for reuse and tracks performance

**How it works**: When a premium user asks a question, the CAA doesn't just retrieve similar text. Instead, it:
1. **Analyzes the query** and user's learning mode (chat, quiz, deep-dive)
2. **Performs hybrid retrieval** combining semantic and keyword search
3. **Traverses the knowledge graph** to find related concepts and prerequisites
4. **Reranks results** using cross-encoders for relevance and factuality
5. **Checks sufficiency** - if context isn't enough, it expands iteratively
6. **Compresses intelligently** while preserving citations and facts
7. **Enriches with tools** when needed (calculations, code execution, web search)
8. **Assembles final context** with full provenance and traceability

**Research-Based Features:**
- **Sufficiency Checking**: Reduces hallucinations by ensuring context can actually answer the query
- **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Significantly improves relevance over simple similarity
- **Mode-Aware Retrieval**: Different strategies for chat vs quiz vs deep-dive
- **Provenance Tracking**: Every piece of context includes source, retrieval method, and graph path
- **Iterative Expansion**: If context is insufficient, it automatically expands retrieval

**Example**: When a user asks "Explain backpropagation," the CAA:
1. Retrieves text chunks about backpropagation
2. Traverses the knowledge graph to find prerequisites (calculus, chain rule)
3. Finds related concepts (gradient descent, neural networks)
4. Reranks for pedagogical relevance and factuality
5. Checks if the context is sufficient to explain backpropagation
6. Compresses while preserving key facts and examples
7. Adds tool outputs if needed (calculations, code examples)
8. Returns assembled context with full provenance for transparency

### 3. **Advanced Features**
