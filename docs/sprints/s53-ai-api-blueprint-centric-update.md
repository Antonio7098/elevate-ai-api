# Sprint 53: AI API Blueprint-Centric Architecture Update

**Signed off** DO NOT PROCEED UNLESS SIGNED OFF BY ANTONIO
**Date Range:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Primary Focus:** elevate-ai-api - Complete Architecture Overhaul to Match New Blueprint-Centric System
**Overview:** Update the elevate-ai-api to implement the new blueprint-centric architecture established in sprints 50-52. This involves creating new database models, core services, knowledge graph foundation, and mastery tracking system to ensure compatibility with the new core API architecture.

**Critical Integration Analysis:**
- **Service Integration Gap**: Current AI API services (RAG, question generation, primitive extraction) need adaptation for blueprint sections
- **Schema Alignment Challenge**: AI API models must match Core API's BlueprintSection hierarchy for seamless integration
- **Content Generation Adaptation**: Existing services need to generate content mapped to specific blueprint sections and criteria
- **Vector Store Integration**: Current vector indexing needs enhancement for hierarchical blueprint section support
- **Knowledge Graph Enhancement**: Basic relationship models exist but need traversal algorithms for context assembly
- **API Contract Alignment**: Existing endpoints need updates to support new blueprint-centric request/response schemas
