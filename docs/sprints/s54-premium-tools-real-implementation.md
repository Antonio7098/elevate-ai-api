## IV. Technical Architecture & Implementation Details

### **Tavily Integration (Task 3)**
**Yes, we can use Tavily search engine!** Here's why it's ideal:

**Advantages of Tavily:**
- **Real-time Search**: Provides current, up-to-date information
- **Multiple Sources**: Aggregates from various search engines and news sources
- **Structured Results**: Returns well-formatted data perfect for AI consumption
- **API-First**: Designed specifically for AI applications
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse
- **Cost Effective**: Competitive pricing for enterprise use

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
# Example Tavily integration structure
class TavilySearchService:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = "https://api.tavily.com"
        self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
    
    async def search(self, query: str, search_type: str = "basic") -> dict:
        """Perform web search using Tavily API"""
        params = {
            "api_key": self.api_key,
            "query": query,
            "search_depth": search_type,
            "include_answer": True,
            "include_raw_content": False
        }
        
        async with self.session.get(f"{self.base_url}/search", params=params) as response:
            return await response.json()
    
    async def get_realtime_data(self, data_type: str, params: dict) -> dict:
        """Fetch real-time data (weather, stocks, news)"""
        # Implementation for specific data types
        pass
```

### **Service Architecture Overview**
```
Premium Tools Service Layer
├── Calculator Service (sympy-based)
├── Code Execution Service (Docker containers)
├── Web Search Service (Tavily + fallbacks)
├── Diagram Generation Service (Graphviz/Mermaid)
├── Example Generation Service (AI-powered)
└── Integration Layer (API Gateway, Monitoring)
```

### **Security & Performance Considerations**
- **Container Isolation**: All code execution runs in isolated Docker containers
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and execution time constraints
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of expensive tool operations
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache frequently requested results
- **Async Processing**: Handle long-running operations efficiently
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and performance metrics

### **Integration with Existing Premium System**
The new tools will integrate seamlessly with:
- **Context Assembly Agent**: Tool outputs enrich assembled context
- **Multi-Agent System**: Tools available to all expert agents
- **Premium Endpoints**: New tool-specific endpoints for premium users
- **Monitoring System**: Tool usage tracking and cost optimization
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across tool instances

This implementation will transform the current mock system into a production-ready, enterprise-grade tool integration platform that significantly enhances the value proposition for premium users.
