# Sprint 34: Premium Advanced RAG Foundation

**Signed off** DO NOT PROCEED UNLESS SIGNED OFF BY ANTONIO
**Date Range:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Primary Focus:** Premium AI API - Advanced RAG Foundation with GraphRAG and Multi-Agent Orchestration
**Overview:** This sprint establishes the foundation for the premium intelligent learning system by implementing advanced RAG techniques, GraphRAG with Neo4j integration, and the initial multi-agent orchestration framework. This builds on existing blueprint lifecycle management (Sprint 25) and creates the core infrastructure that will power premium users' advanced learning experiences.
