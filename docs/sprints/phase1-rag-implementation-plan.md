# Phase 1: RAG Core Implementation Plan

**Overview:** This document outlines the complete implementation plan for Phase 1 of the RAG core system, covering Sprints 05-08.

## Sprint Overview

### Sprint 05: Vector Database Foundation
**Focus:** Establish foundational vector database infrastructure
- Vector database dependencies and client wrappers
- Embedding services (OpenAI, Google, local fallback)
- Basic indexing functionality
- Configuration and environment setup

### Sprint 06: Blueprint Ingestion Pipeline  
**Focus:** Transform LearningBlueprints into searchable TextNodes
- Blueprint parsing and TextNode creation
- Vector indexing pipeline with metadata
- `/index-blueprint` endpoint with async processing
- Metadata filtering capabilities

### Sprint 07: RAG Chat Core
**Focus:** Implement core RAG-powered chat functionality
- Query transformation and semantic search
- Context assembly with multi-tier memory
- Response generation with user preferences
- Complete chat endpoint implementation

### Sprint 08: Advanced RAG Features
**Focus:** Advanced features and optimization
- Hybrid search and self-correction
- Inline co-pilot optimization
- Cost optimization and performance monitoring
- Error handling and resilience

## Technical Architecture

### Vector Database Layer
- **Primary:** Pinecone for production
- **Development:** ChromaDB for local development
- **Embeddings:** OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (cost-efficient)
- **Fallback:** Google embeddings and local sentence-transformers

### Blueprint Processing Pipeline
```
LearningBlueprint → Parser → TextNodes → Vector Store → Searchable Knowledge Base
```

### RAG Chat Pipeline
```
User Query → Query Transform → Vector Search → Context Assembly → LLM Response → Self-Correction
```

### Multi-Tier Memory System
- **Tier 1:** Conversational Buffer (last 5-10 messages)
- **Tier 2:** Session State JSON (structured scratchpad)
- **Tier 3:** Knowledge Base (vector DB) + Cognitive Profile

## Key Implementation Principles

### Cost Optimization
- Model tiering (cheap for simple tasks, powerful for complex)
- Aggressive caching for deconstruction results
- Context pruning and token optimization
- Usage monitoring and alerts

### Performance
- Smart triggering with debouncing for inline co-pilot
- Efficient retrieval (top 1-2 results for suggestions)
- Batch processing for indexing
- Connection pooling and error handling

### Quality Assurance
- Chain-of-Verification (CoV) for self-correction
- Factual accuracy checking against source material
- Confidence scoring and fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive testing and validation

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Vector Database
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_environment
CHROMA_PERSIST_DIRECTORY=./chroma_db  # For local development

# Embedding Services
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key

# Optional: Local embeddings
SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_MODEL=all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

### New Dependencies to Add
```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
pinecone-client = "^3.0.0"
chromadb = "^0.4.0"
sentence-transformers = "^2.2.0"
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Vector DB Performance:** Implement connection pooling and caching
- **Embedding Costs:** Use model tiering and local fallbacks
- **Response Quality:** Implement CoV and confidence scoring
- **Scalability:** Design for horizontal scaling from the start

### Operational Risks
- **API Rate Limits:** Implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers
- **Service Failures:** Add graceful degradation and fallbacks
- **Cost Overruns:** Monitor usage and implement alerts
- **Data Quality:** Validate blueprints and implement error handling

## Next Steps After Phase 1

### Phase 2: Intelligent & Trustworthy Agent
- Advanced query transformations
- Multi-hop reasoning
- Tool use and external integrations
- Enhanced self-correction

### Phase 3: Advanced Synthesis & Long-Term Autonomy
- Complex synthesis capabilities
- Stateful agents
- Context pruning and management
- Long-term learning and adaptation

## Getting Started

1. **Review Sprint 05** and sign off to begin implementation
2. **Set up environment variables** for vector database and embedding services
3. **Add dependencies** to `pyproject.toml`
4. **Follow sprint tasks** in order, updating implementation summaries
5. **Test each component** thoroughly before moving to the next sprint

Each sprint builds upon the previous one, so it's important to complete and validate each sprint before proceeding to the next.
