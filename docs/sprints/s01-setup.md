# Sprint 01: Initial Project Setup

**Signed off** Antonio
**Date Range:** [2025-06-24] - [Fill End Date]  
**Primary Focus:** Project Initialization, Structure, and Core Configuration  
**Overview:** Establish the foundational codebase, directory structure, and core configuration for Elevate AI API. Ensure all environment, security, and tooling prerequisites are in place for rapid, modular development.

    - [x] *Sub-task 1.1:* Set up a new Python 3.11+ project using FastAPI
    - [x] *Sub-task 1.2:* Use Poetry (recommended) or Pipenv for dependency management and virtual environment
- [x] **Task 2:** Establish Project Structure
    - [x] *Sub-task 2.1:* Create `/app` directory with submodules: `/api`, `/core`, `/models`
    - [x] *Sub-task 2.2:* Add `/tests` directory for unit tests
    - [x] *Sub-task 2.3:* Add `README.md` and `.env` files
- [x] **Task 3:** Implement Core Configuration
    - [x] *Sub-task 3.1:* Use `.env` file for all external configuration (LLM API keys, DB URLs, vector DB keys)
    - [x] *Sub-task 3.2:* Use `pydantic-settings` for typed config loading
    - [x] *Sub-task 3.3:* Implement API key security for endpoints using FastAPI Security dependencies

    - [x] *Sub-task 4.1:* Add LlamaIndex as the primary AI framework
    - [x] *Sub-task 4.2:* Choose and configure initial vector store Pinecone
- [x] **Task 5:** Prepare for Core Deconstruction Engine
    - [x] *Sub-task 5.1:* Plan and stub `LearningBlueprint` Pydantic model in `app/models/learning_blueprint.py`
    - [x] *Sub-task 5.2:* Outline specialist agent functions in `app/core/deconstruction.py`
    - [x] *Sub-task 5.3:* Outline dispatcher logic in `app/api/endpoints.py`
- [x] **Task 6:** Testing & Validation Setup
    - [x] *Sub-task 6.1:* Add initial test stubs for blueprint generation
    - [x] *Sub-task 6.2:* Prepare sample input and "ideal" output for validation

## II. Agent's Implementation Summary & Notes

**Regarding Task 1: Project Repository Initialization**
* Set up a new Poetry-based Python project for FastAPI.
* Node.js artifacts removed; Python 3.12+ confirmed.

**Regarding Task 2: Project Structure**
* Created `/app` with `api`, `core`, and `models` submodules.
* Added `/tests` for unit tests, and created `README.md` and `env.example`.

**Regarding Task 3: Core Configuration**
* `.env` template and `app/core/config.py` for environment/config management using pydantic-settings.
* API key security implemented in FastAPI.

**Regarding Task 4: Tooling**
* Poetry for dependency management.
* FastAPI, Pydantic, Uvicorn, and dev tools (pytest, black, isort, mypy) installed.

**Regarding Task 5: Core Stubs**
* `LearningBlueprint` Pydantic model and all submodels in `app/models/learning_blueprint.py`.
* Specialist agent stubs in `app/core/deconstruction.py`.
* Stubs for chat and indexing modules.
* API endpoints in `app/api/endpoints.py` with placeholder logic.

**Regarding Task 6: Testing & Validation**
* Test stubs for models and endpoints in `/tests`.
