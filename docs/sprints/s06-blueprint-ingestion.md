# Sprint 06: Blueprint Ingestion Pipeline

**Signed off** Antonio
**Date Range:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Primary Focus:** Blueprint-to-Node Ingestion Pipeline
**Overview:** Implement the core pipeline that transforms LearningBlueprints into searchable TextNodes in the vector database, with rich metadata extraction and efficient indexing.

    - [ ] *Sub-task 5.2:* Implement filtering by locus type, UUE stage
    - [ ] *Sub-task 5.3:* Add relationship-based retrieval
    - [ ] *Sub-task 5.4:* Create metadata indexing for fast filtering
- [ ] **Task 6:** Testing and Validation
    - [ ] *Sub-task 6.1:* Create unit tests for blueprint parsing
    - [ ] *Sub-task 6.2:* Add integration tests for indexing pipeline
    - [ ] *Sub-task 6.3:* Test metadata filtering and retrieval
    - [ ] *Sub-task 6.4:* Validate with sample blueprints from deconstructions/
