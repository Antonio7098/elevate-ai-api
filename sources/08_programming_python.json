Common data types include integers, floats, strings, and booleans.\n\n## Functions\nFunctions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They are defined using the 'def' keyword and can accept parameters and return values.\n\n## Control Structures\nPython uses if-else statements for decision making and loops (for, while) for repetitive tasks.\n\n## Object-Oriented Programming\nPython supports OOP with classes and objects, allowing for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism."
