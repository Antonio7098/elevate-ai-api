Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space.\n\n## Atoms and Molecules\nAtoms are the basic building blocks of matter. They consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. When atoms combine, they form molecules.\n\n## Chemical Reactions\nChemical reactions occur when substances interact to form new substances. The law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction.\n\n## States of Matter\nMatter exists in three main states: solid, liquid, and gas. The state depends on temperature and pressure conditions."
